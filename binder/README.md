This directory holds configuration files for https://mybinder.org/.

A Binder instance can be launched by visiting this URL:

https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/master?urlpath=lab-dev

To check out a different version, just replace "master" with the desired
branch/tag name or commit hash.

If there is an error with the launched application, you can append
`edit/jupyterlab-dev.log` to the URL (after `lab-dev/`) to see the server logs.

Please note that this setup is developer focused.
For a more user-focused Binder use this URL:

https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-demo/master?urlpath=lab/tree/demo/Lorenz.ipynb
