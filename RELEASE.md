# Making a JupyterLab release

This document guides a contributor through creating a release of JupyterLab.

Review `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Make sure all the tools needed to generate the
built JavaScript files are properly installed.

## Creating a full release

We publish the npm packages, a Python source package, and a Python universal
binary wheel. We also publish a conda package on conda-forge (see below). See
the Python docs on [package
uploading](https://packaging.python.org/guides/tool-recommendations/) for twine
setup instructions and for why twine is the recommended method.

## Getting a clean environment

For convenience, here is a script for getting a completely clean repo. This
makes sure that we don't have any extra tags or commits in our repo (especially
since we will push our tags later in the process), and that we are on the correct branch. The script creates a conda env, pulls down a git checkout with the
appropriate branch, and installs JupyterLab with `pip install -e .`.

Make sure you are running an sh-compatible shell, and it is set up to be able to do `conda activate`. Then do:

```bash
source scripts/release_prep.sh <branch_name>
```

## Bump version

The next step is to bump the appropriate version numbers. We use
[bump2version](https://github.com/c4urself/bump2version) to manage the Python
version, and we keep the JS versions and tags in sync with the release cycle.

Here is an example of how version numbers progress through a release process.
Choose and run an appropriate command to bump version numbers for this release.

| Command                    | Python Version Change | NPM Version change                 |
| -------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `jlpm bumpversion minor`   | x.y.z-> x.(y+1).0.a0  | All a.b.c -> a.(b+10).0-alpha.0    |
| `jlpm bumpversion build`   | x.y.z.a0-> x.y.z.a1   | All a.b.c-alpha.0 -> a.b.c-alpha.1 |
| `jlpm bumpversion release` | x.y.z.a1-> x.y.z.b0   | All a.b.c-alpha.1 -> a.b.c-beta.0  |
| `jlpm bumpversion release` | x.y.z.a1-> x.y.z.rc0  | All a.b.c-alpha.1 -> a.b.c-rc.0    |
| `jlpm bumpversion release` | x.y.z.rc0-> x.y.z     | All a.b.c-rc0 -> a.b.c             |
| `jlpm bumpversion patch`   | x.y.z -> x.y.(z+1)    | Changed a.b.c -> a.b.(c+1)         |

Note: For a minor release, we bump the JS packages by 10 versions so that
we are not competing amongst the minor releases for version numbers.
We are essentially sub-dividing semver to allow us to bump minor versions
of the JS packages as many times as we need to for minor releases of the
top level JupyterLab application.

Other note: It's ok if `yarn-deduplicate` exits with a non zero code. This is
expected!

### JS major release(s)

In a major Python release, we can have one or more JavaScript packages also have
a major bump. During the prerelease stage of a major release, if there is a
backwards-incompatible change to a JS package, bump the major version number for
that JS package:

`jlpm bump:js:major [...packages]`

Results:

- Python package is not affected.
- JS dependencies are also bumped a major version.
- Packages that have already had a major bump in this prerelease cycle are not affected.
- All affected packages changed to match the current release type of the Python package (`alpha`, `beta`, or `rc`).

## Publishing Packages

Now publish the JS packages

```bash
npm run publish:js
```

If there is a network error during JS publish, run `npm run publish:js --skip-build` to resume publish without requiring another clean and build phase of the JS packages.

Note that the use of `npm` instead of `jlpm` is [significant on Windows](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6733).

Next, prepare the python release by running:

```bash
npm run prepare:python-release
```

This will update the Python package to use the new JS packages and
create the Python release assets. Note: sometimes the npm registry
is slow to update with the new packages, so this script tries to fetch
the packages until they are available.

At this point, run the `./scripts/release_test.sh` to test the wheel in
a fresh conda environment with and without extensions installed. Open and run
the Outputs notebook and verify everything runs properly. Also add a cell with the following code and make sure the widget renders:

```python
from ipywidgets import IntSlider
IntSlider()
```

## Finish

Follow instructions printed at the end of the publish step above:

```bash
twine upload dist/*
git push origin --tags <BRANCH>
```

These lines:

- upload to pypi with twine
- double-check what branch you are on, then push changes to the correct upstream branch with the `--tags` option.

## Post release candidate checklist

- [ ] Modify and run `python scripts/milestone_check.py` to check the issues assigned to this milestone
- [ ] Write [release highlights](CHANGELOG.md), starting with:
  ```bash
  loghub jupyterlab/jupyterlab -m XXX -t $GITHUB_TOKEN --template scripts/release_template.txt
  ```
- [ ] Test the release candidate in a clean environment
- [ ] Make sure the CI builds pass
  - The build will fail if we publish a new package because by default it is
    private. Use `npm access public @jupyterlab/<name>` to make it public.
  - The build will fail if we forget to include `style/` in the `files:`
    of a package (it will fail on the `jupyter lab build` command because
    webpack cannot find the referenced styles to import.
- [ ] Update the other repos:
  - [ ] https://github.com/jupyterlab/extension-cookiecutter-js
  - [ ] https://github.com/jupyterlab/extension-cookiecutter-ts
  - [ ] https://github.com/jupyterlab/mimerender-cookiecutter
  - [ ] https://github.com/jupyterlab/mimerender-cookiecutter-ts
  - [ ] https://github.com/jupyterlab/theme-cookiecutter
  - [ ] https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyter-renderers
- [ ] Add a tag to [ts cookiecutter](https://github.com/jupyterlab/extension-cookiecutter-ts) with the new JupyterLab version
- [ ] Update the extension examples:
  - [ ] [Notebook toolbar button](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/blob/3.3.x/docs/source/extension/notebook.rst#adding-a-button-to-the-toolbar)
- [ ] Update the [extension tutorial](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/blob/3.3.x/RELEASE.md#updating-the-extension-tutorial)
- [ ] At this point, there may have been some more commits merged. Run `python scripts/milestone_check.py` to check the issues assigned to this milestone one more time. Update changelog if necessary.

Now do the actual final release:

- [ ] Run `jlpm run bumpversion release` to switch to final release
- [ ] Push the commit and tags to master
- [ ] Run `npm run publish:all` to publish the packages
- [ ] Create a branch for the release and push to GitHub
- [ ] Update the API [docs](#updating-api-docs)
- [ ] Merge the PRs on the other repos and set the default branch of the
      xckd repo
- [ ] Publish to [conda-forge](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/blob/3.3.x/RELEASE.md#publishing-to-conda-forge).

After a few days (to allow for possible patch releases), set up development for
the next release:

- [ ] Run `jlpm run bumpversion minor` to bump to alpha for the next alpha release
- [ ] Put the commit and tags to master
- [ ] Run `npm run publish:all` to publish the packages
- [ ] Release the other repos as appropriate
- [ ] Update version for [binder](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/blob/3.3.x/RELEASE.md#update-version-for-binder)

### Updating the extension tutorial

- Clone the repo if you don't have it

```bash
git clone git@github.com:jupyterlab/jupyterlab_apod.git
```

#### Simple updates by rebasing

If the updates are simple, it may be enough to check out a new branch based on
the current base branch, then rebase from the root commit, editing the root
commit and other commits that involve installing packages to update to the new
versions:

```bash
git checkout -b BRANCH # whatever the new version is, e.g., 1.0
git rebase -i --root
```

"Edit" the commits that involve installing packages, so you can update the
`package.json`. Amend the last commit to bump the version number in package.json
in preparation for publishing to npm. Then skip down to the step below about
publishing the extension tutorial. If the edits are more substantial than just
updating package versions, then do the next steps instead.

#### Creating the tutorial from scratch

- Create a new empty branch in the extension repo.

```bash
git checkout --orphan name-of-branch
git rm -rf .
git clean -dfx
cookiecutter -o initial path-to-local-extension-cookiecutter-ts
# Fill in the values from the previous branch package.json initial commit
cp -r initial/jupyterlab_apod .
rm -rf initial
```

- Create a new PR in JupyterLab.
- Run through the tutorial in the PR, making commits and updating
  the tutorial as appropriate.
- For the publish section of the readme, use the `README`
  file from the previous branch, as well as the `package.json` fields up to
  `license`. Bump the version number in preparation for publishing to npm.

#### Publishing extension tutorial changes

- Tag commits in the branch with the appropriate `branch-step` tag. If you are at the final commit, you can tag all commits with the below, replacing `BRANCH` with the branch name (e.g., `1.0-01-show-a-panel`) ```bash
  git tag BRANCH-01-show-a-panel HEAD~4
  git tag BRANCH-02-show-an-image HEAD~3
  git tag BRANCH-03-style-and-attribute HEAD~2
  git tag BRANCH-04-refactor-and-refresh HEAD~1
  git tag BRANCH-05-restore-panel-state HEAD

  ```

  ```

- Push the branch with the new tags
  ```bash
  git push origin BRANCH --tags
  ```
  Set the branch as the default branch (see `github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab_apod/settings/branches`).
- If there were changes to the example in the documentation, submit a PR to JupyterLab
- Publish the new `jupyterlab_apod` python package. Make sure to update the version
  number in the last commit of the branch.
  ```bash
  twine upload dist/*
  ```

If you make a mistake and need to start over, clear the tags using the
following pattern (replacing `BRANCH` with the branch name):

```bash
git tag | grep BRANCH | xargs git tag -d
```

### Publishing to conda-forge

- If no requirements have changed, wait for the conda-forge autotick-bot.
- Otherwise:
- Get the sha256 hash for conda-forge release:

```bash
shasum -a 256 dist/*.tar.gz
```

- Fork https://github.com/conda-forge/jupyterlab-feedstock
- Create a PR with the version bump
- Update `recipe/meta.yaml` with the new version and md5 and reset the build number to 0.

## Updating API Docs

Run `source scripts/docs_push.sh` to update the `gh-pages` branch that backs http://jupyterlab.github.io/jupyterlab/.

## Making a patch release

- Backport the change to the previous release branch
- Run the following script, where the package is in `/packages/package-folder-name` (note that multiple packages can be given, or no packages for a Python-only patch release):

```bash
jlpm run patch:release package-folder-name
```

- Push the resulting commit and tag

## Update version for binder

Each time we release JupyterLab, we should update the version of JupyterLab
used in binder and repo2docker. Here is an example PR that updates the
relevant files:

https://github.com/jupyter/repo2docker/pull/169/files

This needs to be done in both the conda and pip buildpacks in both the
frozen and non-frozen version of the files.
