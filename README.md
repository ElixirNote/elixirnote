An extensible environment for interactive and reproducible computing, based on the
Jupyter Notebook and Ecosystem.

![ecosystem](/jupyterlab/staging/assets/elixir-ecosystem-v2.svg)

[ElixirNote](https://github.com/ElixirNote/elixirnote/tags) is the next-generation user interface for [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) offering
all the familiar building blocks of the classic Jupyter Notebook (notebook,
terminal, text editor, file browser, rich outputs, etc.) in a flexible and
powerful user interface. However, [JupyterLab](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is also a good choice.
ElixirNote will eventually replace the classic Jupyter Notebook.

ElixirNote can be extended using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) packages
that use our public APIs. The _prebuilt_ extensions can be distributed
via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/search/?q=jupyterlab&o=-created&c=Framework+%3A%3A+Jupyter),
conda, and other package managers. The _source_ extensions can be installed
directly from npm (search for [jupyterlab-extension](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:jupyterlab-extension)) but require additional build step.
You can also find ElixirNote extensions exploring topic [jupyterlab-extension](https://ciusji.gitbook.io/elixirnote/guides/extensions).
To learn more about extensions, see the [user documentation](https://ciusji.gitbook.io/elixirnote/guides/extensions).

The current ElixirNote releases are suitable for general
usage, and the extension APIs will continue to
evolve for ElixirNote extension developers.

Read the current ElixirNote documentation on [ElixirNote Docs](https://ciusji.gitbook.io/elixirnote/).

## Getting started

### Installation

Project installation instructions from the git sources are available in the [contributor documentation](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### pip

If you use `pip`, you can install it with:

```shell
# Clone ElixirServer
git git@github.com:ElixirNote/elixirserver.git
cd elixirserver
pip install -e .
# Clone ElixirNote
git clone git@github.com:ElixirNote/elixirnote.git
cd elixirnote
pip install -e ".[dev,test]"
jlpm install
jlpm run build  # Build the dev mode assets (optional)
jlpm run build:core  # Build the core mode assets (optional)
jupyter lab build  # Build the app dir assets (optional)
```

### Running

Start up ElixirNote using:

```bash
jupyter lab --dev-mode --watch --allow-root --no-browser --ip=0.0.0.0
```

If you want load extensions in dev mode:

```bash
jupyter lab --dev-mode --watch --allow-root --no-browser --extensions-in-dev-mode --ip=0.0.0.0
```

ElixirNote will open automatically in the browser. See the [documentation](https://ciusji.gitbook.io/elixirnote/guides/get-started) for additional details.

If you encounter an error like "Command 'jupyter' not found", please make sure `PATH` environment variable is set correctly. Alternatively, you can start up ElixirNote using `~/.local/bin/jupyter lab` without changing the `PATH` environment variable.

### Prerequisites and Supported Browsers

The latest versions of the following browsers are currently _known to work_:

- Firefox
- Chrome
- Safari

See our [documentation](https://ciusji.gitbook.io/elixirnote/guides/installation) for additional details.
