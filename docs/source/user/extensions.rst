Extensions
==========

Fundamentally, JupyterLab is designed as an extensible environment. JupyterLab
extensions can customize or enhance any part of JupyterLab. They can provide
new themes, file viewers and editors, or renderers for rich outputs in
notebooks. Extensions can add items to the menu or command palette, keyboard
shortcuts, or settings in the settings system. Extensions can provide an API
for other extensions to use and can depend on other extensions. In fact, the
whole of JupyterLab itself is simply a collection of extensions that are no
more powerful or privileged than any custom extension.

For information about developing extensions, see the :ref:`developer
documentation <developer_extensions>`.

Installing Extensions
---------------------

A JupyterLab extension contains JavaScript that is installed into Jupyterlab and
run in the browser. An extension contains one or more plugins that extend JupyterLab.
The preferred JupyterLab extension type is a *prebuilt extension* because it does not
require rebuilding JupyterLab JavaScript files.

Most JupyterLab extensions can be installed using Python :ref:`pip <user_trove_classifiers>`
or ``conda`` packages. These packages may also include a server-side component
necessary for the extension to function.

.. _user_trove_classifiers:

Browsing Extensions on PyPI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Python Package Index (PyPI) is a repository of software for the Python
programming language, and the default source of packages for the ``pip`` package
manager. While a `simple text search <https://pypi.org/search/?q=jupyterlab&o=>`__
will reveal hundreds of packages, a number of
`trove classifiers <https://pypi.org/classifiers>`__ are available for packages
to self-describe the features and compatibility provided:

- `Framework :: Jupyter :: JupyterLab <https://pypi.org/search/?c=Framework+%3A%3A+Jupyter+%3A%3A+JupyterLab>`__
- `Framework :: Jupyter :: JupyterLab :: 1 <https://pypi.org/search/?c=Framework+%3A%3A+Jupyter+%3A%3A+JupyterLab+%3A%3A+1>`__
- `Framework :: Jupyter :: JupyterLab :: 2 <https://pypi.org/search/?c=Framework+%3A%3A+Jupyter+%3A%3A+JupyterLab+%3A%3A+2>`__
- `Framework :: Jupyter :: JupyterLab :: 3 <https://pypi.org/search/?c=Framework+%3A%3A+Jupyter+%3A%3A+JupyterLab+%3A%3A+3>`__
- `Framework :: Jupyter :: JupyterLab :: 4 <https://pypi.org/search/?c=Framework+%3A%3A+Jupyter+%3A%3A+JupyterLab+%3A%3A+4>`__
- `Framework :: Jupyter :: JupyterLab :: Extensions <https://pypi.org/search/?c=Framework+%3A%3A+Jupyter+%3A%3A+JupyterLab+%3A%3A+Extensions>`__
- `Framework :: Jupyter :: JupyterLab :: Extensions :: Mime Renderers <https://pypi.org/search/?c=Framework+%3A%3A+Jupyter+%3A%3A+JupyterLab+%3A%3A+Extensions+%3A%3A+Mime+Renderers>`__
- `Framework :: Jupyter :: JupyterLab :: Extensions :: Prebuilt <https://pypi.org/search/?c=Framework+%3A%3A+Jupyter+%3A%3A+JupyterLab+%3A%3A+Extensions+%3A%3A+Prebuilt>`__
- `Framework :: Jupyter :: JupyterLab :: Extensions :: Themes <https://pypi.org/search/?c=Framework+%3A%3A+Jupyter+%3A%3A+JupyterLab+%3A%3A+Extensions+%3A%3A+Themes>`__

.. note::

   These classifiers were accepted in early August 2021, and it will take some
   time for them to be broadly adopted.

   *You can help!* The proposal of classifiers to a packages's ``setup.py``,
   ``setup.cfg``, or ``pyproject.toml`` can make a *great* first open source
   :ref:`contribution <dev_trove_classifiers>`, as such contributions are:

   - easy for *you*, often possible directly through a project's source code
     website, e.g. GitHub or GitLab,
   - easy for maintainers to review and merge, and
   - can have a positive impact on the discoverability of the package

Managing Extensions with ``jupyter labextension``
-------------------------------------------------

The ``jupyter labextension`` command enables you to list all installed extensions,
or disable any extension. It also bring helper commands for developers. See the
help with ``jupyter labextension --help``.

Listing installed extensions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

List all installed extensions with:

.. code:: bash

    jupyter labextension list

.. note::
   ``jupyter labextension`` identifies an extension by its JavaScript package
   name, which may be different from the name of the ``pip`` or ``conda``
   package used to distribute the extension.


.. _enable_disable_config:

Enabling and Disabling Extensions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Disabling an extension prevents all plugins in that extension from running in
JupyterLab (though the code is still loaded). You can disable specific JupyterLab
extensions (including core extensions) too:

.. code:: bash

    jupyter labextension disable my-extension

You can enable a disabled extension with:

.. code:: bash

    jupyter labextension enable my-extension

Installed extensions are enabled by default unless there is configuration
explicitly disabling them.
Extensions can be disabled or enabled using the command line.
Extensions or individual plugins within an extension can be disabled by another
extension.

The priority order for determining whether an extension is enabled or disabled
is as follows:

- Presence of ``<jupyter_config_path>/labconfig/page_config.json`` file(s) with
  a ``disabledExtensions`` key that is a object with package names as keys and boolean values.
- (deprecated) Presence of ``disabledExtensions`` key in ``<lab_app_dir>/settings/page_config.json``.
  This value is a list of extensions to disable, but is deprecated in favor of the
  layered configuration approach in the `labconfig` location(s).
- Presence of ``disabledExtensions`` key in another JupyterLab extension's metadata
  that disables a given extension.  The key is ignored if that extension itself is
  disabled.

When using the command line, you can target the ``--level`` of the config:
``user``, ``system``, or ``sys-prefix`` (default).

An example ``<jupyter_config_path>/labconfig/page_config.json`` could look as
follows:

.. code:: json

   {
      "disabledExtensions": {
            "@jupyterlab/notebook-extension": true
      }
   }

See :ref:`documentation on LabConfig directories <labconfig_directories>` for
more information.

Managing Extensions Using the Extension Manager
-----------------------------------------------

.. _extension_manager:

You can use the Extension Manager in JupyterLab to manage extensions.

.. warning::

   Since JupyterLab v4, the core manager does not handle searching, installing or
   uninstalling extensions. This is due to the multiple managers available to
   distribute extensions.

The Extension Manager is in the :ref:`left sidebar <left-sidebar>`.

.. figure:: ../images/extensions-default.png
   :align: center
   :class: jp-screenshot

   **Figure:** The default view has three components: a search bar, an "Installed"
   section, and a "Discover" section.


Disclaimer
^^^^^^^^^^

.. danger::

    Installing an extension allows it to execute arbitrary code on the server,
    kernel, and the browser. Therefore, we ask you to explicitly acknowledge
    this.


By default, the disclaimer is not acknowledged.

.. figure:: ../images/extensions-disabled.png
   :align: center
   :class: jp-screenshot

   **Figure:** User has not acknowledged the disclaimer


As the disclaimer is not acknowledged, you can search for an extension,
but can not install it (no install button is available).


To install an extension, you first have to explicitly acknowledge the disclaimer.
Once done, this will remain across sessions and the user does not have to
check it again.

.. figure:: ../images/extensions-enabled.png
   :align: center
   :class: jp-screenshot

   **Figure:** Disclaimer checked

For ease of use, you can collapse the disclaimer so it takes less space on
your screen.


Finding Extensions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can use the extension manager to find extensions for JupyterLab. To discovery
freely among the currently available extensions, expand the "Discovery" section.
This triggers a search for all JupyterLab extensions on the NPM registry, and
the results are listed according to the `registry's sort order
<https://docs.npmjs.com/searching-for-and-choosing-packages-to-download#package-search-rank-criteria>`__.
An exception to this sort order is that extensions released by the Jupyter
organization are always placed first. These extensions are distinguished by
a small Jupyter icon next to their name.


.. figure:: ../images/extensions-default.png
   :align: center
   :class: jp-screenshot
   :alt: The discovery extension listing.


Alternatively, you can limit your discovery by using the search bar. This
performs a free-text search of JupyterLab extensions on the NPM registry.

.. image:: ../images/extensions-search.png
   :align: center
   :class: jp-screenshot
   :alt: An example search result in the discovery extension listing.


Installing an Extension
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you have found an extension that you think is interesting, install
it by clicking the "Install" button of the extension list entry.


.. danger::

    Installing an extension allows it to execute arbitrary code on the
    server, kernel, and in the client's browser. You should therefore
    avoid installing extensions you do not trust, and watch out for
    any extensions trying to masquerade as a trusted extension.


A short while after starting the install of an extension, a drop-down should
appear under the search bar indicating that the extension has been
downloaded. The newly installed extension may require to restart JupyterLab.


Managing Installed Extensions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When there are some installed extensions, they will be shown in the "Installed"
section. These can then be uninstalled or disabled. Disabling an extension will
prevent it from being activated, but without rebuilding the application.


.. _extension_listings:

Listings
^^^^^^^^

When searching extensions in the Extension Manager, JupyterLab displays the complete
search result and the user is free to install any source extension. This is the :ref:`default_mode`.

To bring more security, you or your administrator can enable ``blocklists`` or ``allowlists``
mode. JupyterLab will check the extensions against the defined listings.

.. warning::

    Only one mode at a time is allowed. If you or your server administrator configures
    both block and allow listings, the JupyterLab server will not start.


.. figure:: ../images/extensions-simultaneous-block-allow.png
   :align: center
   :class: jp-screenshot

   **Figure:** Simultaneous block and allow listings


The following details the behavior for the :ref:`blocklist_mode` and the :ref:`allowlist_mode`.
The details to enable configure the listings can be read :ref:`listings_conf`.

.. _default_mode:

Default mode
""""""""""""

In the ``default`` mode, no listing is enabled and the search behavior is unchanged and
is the one described previously.

.. _blocklist_mode:

Blocklist mode
""""""""""""""

Extensions can be freely downloaded without going through a vetting process.
However, users can add malicious extensions to a blocklist. The extension manager
will show all extensions except for those that have
been explicitly added to the blocklist. Therefore, the extension manager
does not allow you to install blocklisted extensions.

If you, or your administrator, has enabled the blocklist mode,
JupyterLab will use the blocklist and remove all blocklisted
extensions from your search result.

If you have installed an extension before it has been blocklisted,
the extension entry in the installed list will be highlighted
in red. It is recommended that you uninstall it. You can move
your mouse on the question mark icon to read the instructions.

.. figure:: ../images/extensions-blocked-list.png
   :align: center
   :class: jp-screenshot

   **Figure:** Blocklisted installed extension which should be removed


.. _allowlist_mode:

Allowlist mode
""""""""""""""

An allowlist maintains a set of approved extensions that users can freely
search and install. Extensions need to go through some sort of vetting process
before they are added to the allowlist. When using an allowlist, the extension manager
will only show extensions that have been explicitly added to the allowlist.

If you, or your administrator, has enabled the allowlist mode
JupyterLab will use the allowlist and only show extensions present
in the allowlist. The other extensions will not be show in the search result.

If you have installed an allowlisted extension and at some point
in time that extension is removed from the allowlist, the extension entry
in the installed list will be highlighted in red. It is recommended that
you uninstall it. You can move your mouse on the question mark icon to
read the instructions.

.. figure:: ../images/extensions-allowed-list.png
   :align: center
   :class: jp-screenshot

   **Figure:** The second of the installed extensions was removed from the allowlist and should be removed

.. _listings_conf:

Listing Configuration
"""""""""""""""""""""

You or your administrator can use the following traits to define the listings loading.

- ``blocked_extensions_uris``: A list of comma-separated URIs to fetch a blocklist file from
- ``allowed_extensions_uris``: A list of comma-separated URIs to fetch an allowlist file from
- ``listings_refresh_seconds``: The interval delay in seconds to refresh the lists
- ``listings_request_options``: The optional kwargs to use for the listings HTTP requests

For example, to set blocked extensions, launch the server with
``--LabServerApp.blocked_extensions_uris=http://example.com/blocklist.json`` where
``http://example.com/blocklist.json`` is a JSON file as described below.

The details for the listings_request_options are listed
on `this page <https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/#requests.request>`__
(for example, you could pass ``{'timeout': 10}`` to change the HTTP request timeout value).

The listings are json files hosted on the URIs you have given.

For each entry, you have to define the `name` of the extension as published in the NPM registry.
The ``name`` attribute supports regular expressions.

Optionally, you can also add some more fields for your records (``type``, ``reason``, ``creation_date``,
``last_update_date``). These optional fields are not used in the user interface.

This is an example of a blocklist file.

.. code:: json

   {
     "blocked_extensions": [
       {
         "name": "@jupyterlab-examples/launcher",
         "type": "jupyterlab",
         "reason": "@jupyterlab-examples/launcher is blocklisted for test purpose - Do NOT take this for granted!!!",
         "creation_date": "2020-03-11T03:28:56.782Z",
         "last_update_date":  "2020-03-11T03:28:56.782Z"
       }
     ]
   }


In the following allowed extensions ``@jupyterlab/*`` will allow
all jupyterlab organization extensions.

.. code:: json

   {
     "allowed_extensions": [
       {
         "name": "@jupyterlab/*",
         "type": "jupyterlab",
         "reason": "All @jupyterlab org extensions are allowed, of course…",
         "creation_date": "2020-03-11T03:28:56.782Z",
         "last_update_date":  "2020-03-11T03:28:56.782Z"
       }
     ]
   }


Un-/Installing using ``jupyter labextension``
---------------------------------------------

.. note::

   This way of un-/installing JupyterLab extensions is highly discouraged.

The ``jupyter labextension`` command enables you to install or uninstall
source extensions from `npm <https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:jupyterlab-extension>`__.
See the help with ``jupyter labextension --help``. But to install those
source extensions, you first need to install Node.js.

.. _installing_nodejs:

Installing Node.js
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Source extensions require `Node.js <https://nodejs.org/>`__ to rebuild
JupyterLab and activate the extension. If you use ``conda`` with
``conda-forge`` packages, you can get Node.js with:

.. code:: bash

    conda install -c conda-forge nodejs

If you use ``conda`` with default Anaconda packages (i.e., you don't normally
use ``conda-forge``), you should install Node.js from the Anaconda default
channel with ``conda install nodejs`` instead.

You may also be able to get Node.js from your system package manager, or you
can download Node.js from the `Node.js website <https://nodejs.org/>`__
and install it directly.

.. _install_command:

Installing and Uninstalling Source Extensions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can install source extensions from `npm
<https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:jupyterlab-extension>`__ with:

.. code:: bash

    jupyter labextension install my-extension my-other-extension

Use the ``my-extension@version`` syntax to install a specific version
of an extension, for example:

.. code:: bash

    jupyter labextension install my-extension@1.2.3

You can also install a source extension that is not uploaded to npm, i.e.,
``my-extension`` can be a local directory containing the extension, a
gzipped tarball, or a URL to a gzipped tarball.

.. note::
    Installing a source extension will require :ref:`installing
    Node.js <installing_nodejs>` and require a rebuild of JupyterLab.

Uninstall source extensions using the command:

.. code:: bash

    jupyter labextension uninstall my-extension my-other-extension

If you are installing/uninstalling several extensions in several stages,
you may want to defer rebuilding JupyterLab by including the flag
``--no-build`` in the install/uninstall step. Once you are ready to
rebuild, you can run the command:

.. code:: bash

    jupyter lab build

.. note::
   If you are rebuilding JupyterLab on Windows, you may encounter a
   ``FileNotFoundError`` due to the default path length on Windows.  Node
   modules are stored in a deeply nested directory structure, so paths can get
   quite long. If you have administrative access and are on Windows 8 or 10,
   you can update the registry setting using these instructions:
   https://stackoverflow.com/a/37528731.
