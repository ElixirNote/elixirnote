## 3.1.0

([Full Changelog](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/compare/v3.0.6...60f37be54a714c391fad5500cb57055af1492591))

### User-facing changes

- From JupyterLab 3.1, file documents and notebooks have collaborative
  editing using the [Yjs shared editing framework](https://github.com/yjs/yjs).
  Editors are not collaborative by default; to activate it, start JupyterLab
  with the `--collaborative` flag. See full documentation on [collaboration](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/3.3.x/user/rtc.html).
- The undo/redo history in the notebook is now document-wide (tracking changes across all cells); the future verisions will enable restoring the previous behaviour of per-cell undo/redo.
- Table of Contents recieved multiple new features and settings described in the [user documentation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/3.3.x/user/toc.html).
- The debugger recived many improvements, including basic support for evaluating code at a breakpoint, and for variable inspection.
- The closing bracket is no longer automatically added by default; the old behaviour can be re-enabled from the menu bar (`Settings` -> `Auto Close Brackets`) or from the Advanced Settings Editor.
- A new visual indicator was introduced to highlight cells in which the code changed in the editor since last execution:
  <img alt="A GIF of the visual indicator showing up after editing a cell." src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21197331/120619861-ae957d80-c45c-11eb-8640-b25b8b659ad4.gif">
- Many other new features were added as documented below.

### v3.0.0

### User-facing changes

#### Extensions can be installed without building JupyterLab with NodeJS

In JupyterLab 3.0, a new recommended way of distributing and installing
extensions as Python pip or conda packages is available. Installing such
extensions does not require rebuilding JupyterLab and does not require
having NodeJS installed. The previous way of distributing extensions as
npm packages requiring rebuilding JupyterLab is still available as well.
See the
[documentation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/3.3.x/user/extensions.html#extensions)
for more details.

#### The JupyterLab interface supports multiple languages

JupyterLab now provides the ability to set the display language of the
user interface. See the
[documentation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/3.3.x/user/language.html)
for more details.

#### A new visual debugger

JupyterLab now ships with a debugger front-end by default, available for
kernels that support the new debugging protocol. See the
[documentation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/3.3.x/user/debugger.html)
for more details.

#### Improvements to Simple Interface mode and Mobile

The Simple Interface mode (previously Single Document Mode) is now more
streamlined. JupyterLab now supports showing the current file in use in
the browser URL bar, similar to the classic Jupyter Notebook.

#### Table of Contents is now in core

The popular Table of Contents extension is now part of core JupyterLab.
This core extension makes it easy to see an outline view of notebooks
and other documents.

#### Visual filter in file browser

The file browser now has a filter input which filters the list of files
using the same fuzzy matching as the command palette.

#### Property inspector moved to right sidebar

The default interface for JupyterLab now has system-wide sidebar panes
on the left side and sidebar panels that interact with a specific
document (such as the debugger or notebook property inspector) on the
right side. As always, you can move panes between the left and right
sidebars (right click on the sidebar icon, or change it in Advanced
Settings).

#### Command Palette

The command palette is now a floating window that appears on top of your
JupyterLab workspace. This enables users to quickly invoke a command
while keeping the sidebar closed or switching sidebar panels. The
command palette can be put back into the sidebar by adjusting the
default in Advanced Settings.

#### Jupyter Server

JupyterLab 3.0 now depends on [Jupyter
Server](https://jupyter-server.readthedocs.io), which is a new Jupyter
project based on the server portion of the classic Notebook server. See
the [Migration
Guide](https://jupyter-server.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operators/migrate-from-nbserver.html)
to migrate custom notebook configuration to Jupyter Server.

### For Developers

#### Prebuilt Extensions

Users will typically consume prebuilt extensions, which are Python
packages with static assets built using `JupyterLab`. See the updated
APOD tutorial for the workflow of creating a prebuilt extension from
scratch. For existing extensions, there is a new
`python -m jupyterlab.upgrade_extension` script that can be used to
upgrade extensions. The script will update the relevant dependencies and
add the boilerplate to create the Python package. For extensions that
already contained Python packages (typically server extensions), the
files are not overwritten, and some manual copying of content is
required. See the
[example](https://github.com/jupyterlab/extension-examples/pull/119),
which used this script heavily. There are two highlighted commits that
demonstrate upgrading a server extension. Prebuilt extensions are also
known as federated extensions in the changes below, since they use the
federated module capability in Webpack 5.

- Better handling of extensions that provide both prebuilt and source
  extensions.

### User-facing changes

- Display the extension manager in the left sidebar by default. Users
  will need to acknowledge the disclaimer in the extension manager
  before using it.
  ([#8050](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/8050),
  [#8145](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/8145))
- Added `blacklist and whitelist support <extension_listings>` for the
  extension manager
  ([#7989](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/7989))
- Automatically link URLs in notebook output text
  ([#8075](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/8075),
  [#7393](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/7393))

- Added a command to replace the selection in an editor with text
  (inserting if there is no selection). This can be assigned a
  keyboard shortcut, as shown below. We also added a command to go
  through a series of commands and run the first enabled command.
  ([#7908](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/7908)) Here
  is a keyboard shortcut to insert text in a currently-active notebook
  editor:

  ```js
  {
    command: "notebook:replace-selection",
    selector: ".jp-Notebook",
    keys: ["Ctrl L"],
    args: {text: "lambda x: x"}
  }
  ```

  Here is a keyboard shortcut to insert text into an editor of the
  currently active console, file editor, or notebook:

  ```js
  {
    command: "apputils:run-first-enabled",
    selector: "body",
    keys: ["Ctrl L"],
    args: {
      commands: [
        "console:replace-selection",
        "fileeditor:replace-selection",
        "notebook:replace-selection",
      ],
      args: {text: "lambda x: x"}
    }
  }
  ```

  [#5694](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/5694))

### Extension Development Changes

- We have rewritten how extensions provide keyboard shortcuts and
  interact with the settings system. If you previously defined
  keyboard shortcuts or used the settings mechanism, you will need to
  update your extension
  ([#5470](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5470),
  [#5298](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/5298))
- We have renamed the plugin type from `JupyterLabPlugin` to
  `JupyterFrontEndPlugin`. The application arg is also renamed from
  `JupyterLab` to `JupyterFrontEnd` and some its functionality has
  been moved to a separate `ILabShell` plugin
  ([#5845](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5845),
  [#5919](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5919))
- The lab shell `addToMainArea`, `addToLeftArea`, `addToTopArea`,
  `addToRightArea`, and `addToBottomArea` functions have been replaced
  with a single `add()` function that takes the area as an argument.
  Replace `addToMainArea(widget, options)` with
  `add(widget, 'main', options)`, etc.
  ([#5845](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5845))
- Rename `pageUrl` to `appUrl` in the server connection
  ([#6509](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6509),
  [#6508](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6508),
  [#6585](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6585),
  [#6584](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6584))
- `MainAreaWidget` instances now forward update requests to their
  `content`
  ([#6586](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6586),
  [#6571](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6571))
- The theme data attributes are renamed and moved to the document body
  element. If you are relying on these attributes in CSS to
  conditionally style based on the theme, you should update their
  names. For example `data-theme-light` is now `data-jp-theme-light`.
  ([#6566](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6566),
  [#6554](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6554))
- Extensions which require CSS should no longer import their CSS files
  into their Javascript files. Instead, they should specify a root CSS
  file in the `style` attribute in their `package.json`, and
  JupyterLab will automatically import that CSS file.
  ([#6533](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6533),
  [#6530](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6530),
  [#6395](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6395),
  [#6390](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6390))
- `Dialog.prompt` has been replaced by a number of type-specific
  dialogs such as `InputDialog.getString`, `InputDialog.getBoolean`,
  etc. ([#6522](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6522),
  [#6378](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6378),
  [#6327](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6327),
  [#6326](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6326))
- When a `RenderMime` widget is re-rendered, the default behavior is
  to remove any existing content in the DOM. This can be overridden if
  needed.
  ([#6513](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6513),
  [#6505](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6505),
  [#6497](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6497))
- We have updated our internal TypeScript version to 3.5.1 and our
  compile target to `ES2017`. Extensions may need to upgrade their
  TypeScript version and target as well.
  ([#6440](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6440),
  [#6224](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6224))
- We have updated the typings for some of the Kernel messages so that
  they better match the spec.
  ([#6433](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6433))
- A `connectionFailure` signal has been added to some of the manager
  classes, which can be used to detect when a connection to the server
  is lost
  ([#6399](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6399),
  [#6176](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6176),
  [#3324](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/3324))
- Add rate limiting and polling utilities to `coreutils` to use for
  throttling and debouncing of API requests
  ([#6345](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6345),
  [#6346](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6346),

  ,[#6305](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6305),
  [#6157](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6157))

  ([#6339](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6339),
  [#5061](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/5061))
- Provides a signal to see what items are opened in a directory
  listing

  `JupyterFrontEnd`
  ([#5932](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5932))
- Removes the `initialCommand` arg from the terminal creation command.
  ([#5916](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5916))
- Adds `--jp-code-cursor-width0`, `--jp-code-cursor-width1`, and
  `--jp-code-cursor-width2` variables to the themes to support
  changing the cursor width if you change the font size
  ([#5898](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5898))
- Adds the ability to insert a new item to the toolbar before or after
  another item
  ([#5896](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5896),
  [#5894](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/5894))
- Adds the ability for extensions to register new CodeMirror modes
  ([#5829](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5829))
- We have removed the `JUPYTERLAB_xxx_LOADER` Webpack loaders, instead
  you should use the loader directly in the URL as Webpack supports it
  ([#5709](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5709),
  [#4406](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/4406))
- Adds the ability to handle fragments for document widgets
  ([#5630](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5630),
  [#5599](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/5599))
- We have added a `@jupyterlab/ui-components` package that contains
  reusable React components to be used internally and in extensions.
  Feel free to use this to create extension UIs with consistent styles
  ([#5538](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5538))
- The `showErrorMessage` function now lets you customize the buttons
  it uses
  ([#5513](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5513))
- We now provide helpers for using React components within JupyterLab.
  If you were previously using `ReactElementWidget` you should switch
  to using `ReactWidget`.
  ([#5479](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5479),
  [#5766](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/5766),
  [#6595](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6595),
  [#6595](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6595))
- The share link command has been moved to its own extension so that
  it can be overridden
  ([#5460](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5460),
  [#5388](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/5388))
- Creating a new services session now requires passing a kernel model
  instead of a kernel instance
  ([#6503](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6503),
  [#6142](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6142))
- We upgraded the Webpack raw file loader. The new version of the raw
  loader exports ES2015 modules, so this may require changes in
  extensions that import files using the raw loader. For example, if
  you did `require('myfile.md')` to get the content of
  `myfile.md` as a string, you now should import it using
  ES2015 `import` syntax, or use
  `require(\'myfile.md\').default`.
- Widget factories now can support custom cloning behavior from an
  optional source widget
  ([#6060](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6060),
  [#6044](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6044))
- We have renamed the type `InstanceTracker` to `WidgetTracker`
  ([#6569](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/commit/da8e7bda5eebd22319f59e5abbaaa9917872a7e8)).
- In order to add widgets to the main area (e.g. as in the old XKCD

## [v0.34.0](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/releases/tag/v0.34.0)

### August 18, 2018

See the [JupyterLab
0.34.0](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/milestone/16?closed=1)
milestone on GitHub for the full list of pull requests and issues
closed.

### Key Features

- Notebooks, consoles, and text files now have access to completions
  for local tokens.
- Python 3.5+ is now required to use JupyterLab. Python 2 kernels can
  still be run within JupyterLab.
- Added the pipe (`|`) character as a CSV delimiter option.
- Added \"Open From Path\...\"\" to top level `File` menu.
- Added \"Copy Download Link\" to context menu for files.

### Changes for Developers

- Notebooks, consoles, and text files now have access to completions
  for local tokens. If a text file has a running kernel associated
  with its path (as happens with an attached console), it also gets
  completions and tooltips from that kernel.
  ([#5049](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5049))

- The `FileBrowser` widget has a new constructor option
  `refreshInterval`, allowing the creator to customize how often the
  widget polls the storage backend. This can be useful to prevent
  rate-limiting in certain contexts.
  ([#5048](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5048))

- The application shell now gets a pair of CSS data attributes
  indicating the current theme, and whether it is light or dark.
  Extension authors can write CSS rules targeting these to have their
  extension UI elements respond to the application theme. For
  instance, to write a rule targeting whether the theme is overall
  light or dark, you can use

  ```css
  [data-theme-light='true'] your-ui-class {
    background-color: white;
  }
  [data-theme-light='false'] your-ui-class {
    background-color: black;
  }
  ```

  The theme name can also be targeted by writing CSS rules for
  `data-theme-name`.
  ([#5078](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5078))

- The `IThemeManager` interface now exposes a signal for
  `themeChanged`, allowing extension authors to react to changes in
  the theme. Theme extensions must also provide a new boolean property
  `isLight`, declaring whether they are broadly light colored. This
  data allows third-party extensions to react better to the active
  application theme.
  ([#5078](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5078))

- Added a patch to update the `uploads` for each `FileBrowserModel`
  instantly whenever a file upload errors. Previously, the upload that
  erred was only being removed from uploads upon an update. This would
  allow the status bar component and other extensions that use the
  `FileBrowserModel` to be more precise.
  ([#5077](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5077))

- Cell IDs are now passed in the shell message as part of the cell
  metadata when a cell is executed. This helps in developing reactive
  kernels.
  ([#5033](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5033))

- The IDs of all deleted cells since the last run cell are now passed
  as part of the cell metadata on execution. The IDs of deleted cells
  since the last run cell are stored as `deletedCells` in
  `NotebookModel`. This helps in developing reactive kernels.
  ([#5037](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5037))

- The `ToolbarButton` in `apputils` has been refactored with an API
  change and now uses a React component `ToolbarButtonComponent` to
  render its children. It is now a `div` with a single `button` child,
  which in turn as two `span` elements for an icon and text label.
  Extensions that were using the `className` options should rename it
  as `iconClassName`. The `className` options still exists, but it
  used as the CSS class on the `button` element itself. The API
  changes were done to accommodate styling changes to the button.
  ([#5117](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5117))

- The `Toolbar.createFromCommand` function has been replaced by a
  dedicated `ToolbarButton` subclass called `CommandToolbarButton`,
  that wraps a similarly named React component.
  ([#5117](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5117))

- The design and styling of the right and left sidebars tabs has been
  improved to address
  [#5054](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/50). We are
  now using icons to render tabs for the extensions we ship with
  JupyterLab and extension authors are encouraged to do the same (text
  labels still work). Icon based tabs can be used by removing
  `widget.caption` and adding
  `widget.iconClass = '<youriconclass> jp-SideBar-tabIcon';`.
  ([#5117](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5117))

- The style of buttons in JupyterLab has been updated to a borderless
  design.
  ([#5117](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5117))

- A new series of helper CSS classes for stying SVG-based icons at
  different sizes has been added: `jp-Icon`, `jp-Icon-16`,
  `jp-Icon-18`, `jp-Icon-20`.

- The rank of the default sidebar widget has been updated. The main
  change is giving the extension manager a rank of `1000` so that it
  appears at the end of the default items.

- Python 3.5+ is now required to use JupyterLab. Python 2 kernels can
  still be run within JupyterLab.
  ([#5119](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5119))

- JupyterLab now uses `yarn 1.9.4` (aliased as `jlpm`), which now
  allows uses to use Node 10+.
  ([#5121](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5121))

- Clean up handling of `baseUrl` and `wsURL` for `PageConfig` and
  `ServerConnection`.
  ([#5111](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5111))

### Other Changes

- Added the pipe (`|`) character as a CSV delimiter option.
  ([#5112](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5112))
- Added `Open From Path...` to top level `File` menu.
  ([#5108](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5108))
- Added a `saveState` signal to the document context object.
  ([#5096](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5096))
- Added \"Copy Download Link\" to context menu for files.
  ([#5089](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5089))
- Extensions marked as `deprecated` are no longer shown in the
  extension manager.
  ([#5058](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5058))
- Remove `In` and `Out` text from cell prompts. Shrunk the prompt
  width from 90px to 64px. In the light theme, set the prompt colors
  of executed console cells to active prompt colors and reduced their
  opacity to 0.5. In the dark theme, set the prompt colors of executed
  console cells to active prompt colors and set their opacity to 1.
  ([#5097](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5097) and
  [#5130](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5130))

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug in the rendering of the \"New Notebook\" item of the
  command palette.
  ([#5079](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5079))
- We only create the extension manager widget if it is enabled. This
  prevents unnecessary network requests to `npmjs.com`.
  ([#5075](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5075))
- The `running` panel now shows the running sessions at startup.
  ([#5118](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5118))
- Double clicking a file in the file browser always opens it rather
  than sometimes selecting it for a rename.
  ([#5101](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/5101))

### No longer in beta

In JupyterLab 0.33, we removed the "Beta" label to better signal that
JupyterLab is ready for users to use on a daily basis. The extension
developer API is still being stabilized. See the release blog post for
details.
([#4898](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/4898),
[#4920](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4920))

### Workspaces

We added new workspace support, which enables you to have multiple saved
layouts, including in different browser windows. See the
`workspace documentation` for more details.
([#4502](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/4502),
[#4708](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4708),
[#4088](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/4088),
[#4041](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4041)
[#3673](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/3673),
[#4780](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4780))

### Menu items

- "Activate Previously Used Tab" added to the Tab menu
  (`Ctrl/Cmd Shift '`) to toggle between the previously active tabs in
  the main area.
  ([#4296](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4296))
- "Reload From Disk" added to the File menu to reload an open file
  from the state saved on disk.
  ([#4615](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4615))
- "Save Notebook with View State" added to the File menu to persist
  the notebook collapsed and scrolled cell state. We now read the
  `collapsed`, `scrolled`, `jupyter.source_hidden` and
  `jupyter.outputs_hidden` notebook cell metadata when opening.
  `collapsed` and `jupyter.outputs_hidden` are redundant and the
  initial collapsed state is the union of both of them. When the state
  is persisted, if an output is collapsed, both will be written with
  the value `true`, and if it is not, both will not be written.
  ([#3981](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/3981))
- "Increase/Decrease Font Size" added to the text editor settings
  menu. ([#4811](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4811))
- "Show in File Browser" added to a document tab's context menu.
  ([#4500](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4500))
- "Open in New Browser Tab" added to the file browser context menu.
  ([#4315](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4315))
- "Copy Path" added to file browser context menu to copy the
  document's path to the clipboard.
  ([#4582](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4582))
- "Show Left Area" has been renamed to "Show Left Sidebar" for
  consistency (same for right sidebar).
  ([#3818](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/3818))

### Keyboard shortcuts

- "Save As..." given the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl/Cmd Shift S`.
  ([#4560](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4560))
- "Run All Cells" given the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl/Cmd Shift Enter`.
  ([#4558](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4558))
- "notebook:change-to-cell-heading-X" keyboard shortcuts (and
  commands) renamed to "notebook:change-cell-to-heading-X" for
  X=1...6. This fixes the notebook command-mode keyboard shortcuts for
  changing headings.
  ([#4430](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4430))
- The console execute shortcut can now be set to either `Enter` or
  `Shift Enter` as a Console setting.
  ([#4054](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4054))

### Command palette items

- "Notebook" added to the command palette to open a new notebook.
  ([#4812](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4812))

- "Run Selected Text or Current Line in Console" added to the command
  palette to run the selected text or current line from a notebook in
  a console. A default keyboard shortcut for this command is not yet
  provided, but can be added by users with the
  `notebook:run-in-console` command. To add a keyboard shortcut
  `Ctrl G` for this command, use the "Settings" \| "Advanced Settings
  Editor" menu item to open the "Keyboard Shortcuts" advanced
  settings, and add the following JSON in the shortcut JSON object in
  the User Overrides pane (adjust the actual keyboard shortcut if you
  wish).
  ([#3453](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/3453),
  [#4206](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/4206),
  [#4330](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4330))

  ```json
  {
    "command": "notebook:run-in-console",
    "keys": ["Ctrl G"],
    "selector": ".jp-Notebook.jp-mod-editMode"
  }
  ```

- The command palette now renders labels, toggled state, and keyboard
  shortcuts in a more consistent and correct way.
  ([#4533](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4533),
  [#4510](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4510))

### Settings

- "fontFamily", "fontSize", and "lineHeight" settings added to the
  text editor advanced settings.
  ([#4673](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4673))
- Solarized dark and light text editor themes from CodeMirror.
  ([#4445](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4445))

### Larger file uploads

- Support for larger file uploads (\>15MB) when using Jupyter notebook
  server version \>= 5.1.
  ([#4224](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4224))

### Extension management and installation

- New extension manager for installing JupyterLab extensions from npm
  within the JupyterLab UI. You can enable this from the Advanced
  Settings interface.
  ([#4682](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4682),
  [#4925](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4925))
- Please note that to install extensions in JupyterLab, you must use
  NodeJS version 9 or earlier (i.e., not NodeJS version 10). We will
  upgrade yarn, with NodeJS version 10 support, when a [bug in
  yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/5935) is fixed.
  ([#4804](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4804))

### Interface changes

- Wider tabs in the main working area to show longer filenames.
  ([#4801](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4801))
- Initial kernel selection for a notebook or console can no longer be
  canceled: the user must select a kernel.
  ([#4596](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4596))
- Consoles now do not display output from other clients by default. A
  new "Show All Kernel Activity" console context menu item has been
  added to show all activity from a kernel in the console.
  ([#4503](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4503))
- The favicon now shows the busy status of the kernels in JupyterLab.
  ([#4361](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4361),
  [#3957](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/3957),
  [#4966](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4966))

### Renderers

- JupyterLab now ships with a Vega4 renderer by default (upgraded from
  Vega3).
  ([#4806](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4806))
- The HTML sanitizer now allows some extra tags in rendered HTML,
  including `kbd`, `sup`, and `sub`.
  ([#4618](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4618))
- JupyterLab now recognizes the `.tsv` file extension as tab-separated
  files.
  ([#4684](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4684))
- Javascript execution in notebook cells has been re-enabled.
  ([#4515](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4682))

### Changes for developers

- A new signal for observing application dirty status state changes.
  ([#4840](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/4840))
- A new signal for observing notebook cell execution.
  ([#4740](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/4740),
  [#4744](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4744))
- A new `anyMessage` signal for observing any message a kernel sends
  or receives.
  ([#4437](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4437))
- A generic way for different widgets to register a "Save with extras"
  command that appears in the File menu under save.
  ([#3981](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/3981))
- A new API for removing groups from a JupyterLab menu. `addGroup` now
  returns an `IDisposable` which can be used to remove the group.
  `removeGroup` has been removed.
  ([#4890](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4890))
- The `Launcher` now uses commands from the application
  `CommandRegistry` to launch new activities. Extension authors that
  add items to the launcher will need to update them to use commands.
  ([#4757](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4757))
- There is now a top-level `addToBottomArea` function in the
  application, allowing extension authors to add bottom panel items
  like status bars.
  ([#4752](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4752))
- Rendermime extensions can now indicate that they are the default
  rendered widget factory for a file-type. For instance, the default
  widget for a markdown file is a text editor, but the default
  rendered widget is the markdown viewer.
  ([#4692](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4692))
- Add new workspace REST endpoints to `jupyterlab_server` and make
  them available in `@jupyterlab/services`.
  ([#4841](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4841))
- Documents created with a mimerenderer extension can now be accessed
  using an `IInstanceTracker` which tracks them. Include the token
  `IMimeDocumentTracker` in your plugin to access this. The
  `IInstanceTracker` interface has also gained convenience functions
  `find` and `filter` to simplify iterating over instances.
  ([#4762](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4762))
- RenderMime render errors are now displayed to the user.
  ([#4465](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4465))
- `getNotebookVersion` is added to the `PageConfig` object.
  ([#4224](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4224))
- The session `kernelChanged` signal now contains both the old kernel
  and the new kernel to make it easy to unregister things from the old
  kernel.
  ([#4834](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4834))
- The `connectTo` functions for connecting to kernels and sessions are
  now synchronous (returning a connection immediately rather than a
  promise). The DefaultSession `clone` and `update` methods are also
  synchronous now.
  ([#4725](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4725))
- Kernel message processing is now asynchronous, which guarantees the
  order of processing even if a handler is asynchronous. If a kernel
  message handler returns a promise, kernel message processing is
  paused until the promise resolves. The kernel's `anyMessage` signal
  is emitted synchronously when a message is received before
  asynchronous message handling, and the `iopubMessage` and
  `unhandledMessage` signals are emitted during asynchronous message
  handling. These changes mean that the comm `onMsg` and `onClose`
  handlers and the kernel future `onReply`, `onIOPub`, and `onStdin`
  handlers, as well as the comm target and message hook handlers, may
  be asynchronous and return promises.
  ([#4697](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4697))
- Kernel comm targets and message hooks now are unregistered with
  `removeCommTarget` and `removeMessageHook`, instead of using
  disposables. The corresponding `registerCommTarget` and
  `registerMessageHook` functions now return nothing.
  ([#4697](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4697))
- The kernel `connectToComm` function is synchronous, and now returns
  the comm rather than a promise to the comm.
  ([#4697](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4697))
- The `KernelFutureHandler` class `expectShell` constructor argument
  is renamed to `expectReply`.
  ([#4697](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4697))
- The kernel future `done` returned promise now resolves to undefined
  if there is no reply message.
  ([#4697](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4697))
- The `IDisplayDataMsg` is updated to have the optional `transient`
  key, and a new `IUpdateDisplayDataMsg` type was added for update
  display messages.
  ([#4697](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4697))
- The `uuid` function from `@jupyterlab/coreutils` is removed. Instead
  import `UUID` from `@phosphor/coreutils` and use `UUID.uuid4()` .
  ([#4604](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4604))
- Main area widgets like the launcher and console inherit from a
  common `MainAreaWidget` class which provides a content area
  (`.content`) and a toolbar (`.toolbar`), consistent focus handling
  and activation behavior, and a spinner displayed until the given
  `reveal` promise is resolved. Document widgets, like the notebook
  and text editor and other documents opened from the document
  manager, implement the `IDocumentWidget` interface (instead of
  `DocumentRegistry.IReadyWidget`), which builds on `MainAreaWidget`
  and adds a `.context` attribute for the document context and makes
  dirty handling consistent. Extension authors may consider inheriting
  from the `MainAreaWidget` or `DocumentWidget` class for consistency.
  Several effects from these changes are noted below.
  ([#3499](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/3499),
  [#4453](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4453))
  - The notebook panel `.notebook` attribute is renamed to
    `.content`.
  - The text editor is now the `.content` of a `DocumentWidget`, so
    the top-level editor widget has a toolbar and the editor itself
    is `widget.content.editor` rather than just `widget.editor`.
  - Mime documents use a `MimeContent` widget embedded inside of a
    `DocumentWidget` now.
  - Main area widgets and document widgets now have a `revealed`
    promise which resolves when the widget has been revealed (i.e.,
    the spinner has been removed). This should be used instead of
    the `ready` promise.

Changes in the JupyterLab code infrastructure include:

- The JupyterLab TypeScript codebase is now compiled to ES2015 (ES6)
  using TypeScript 2.9. We also turned on the TypeScript
  `esModuleInterop` flag to enable more natural imports from
  non-es2015 JavaScript modules. With the update to ES2015 output,
  code generated from async/await syntax became much more manageable,
  so we have started to use async/await liberally throughout the
  codebase, especially in tests. Because we use Typedoc for API
  documentation, we still use syntax compatible with TypeScript 2.7
  where Typedoc is used. Extension authors may have some minor
  compatibility updates to make. If you are writing an extension in
  TypeScript, we recommend updating to TypeScript 2.9 and targeting
  ES2015 output as well.
  ([#4462](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4462),
  [#4675](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4675),
  [#4714](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4714),
  [#4797](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4797))
- The JupyterLab codebase is now formatted using
  [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier). By default the
  development environment installs a pre-commit hook that formats your
  staged changes.
  ([#4090](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4090))
- Updated build infrastructure using webpack 4 and better typing.
  ([#4702](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4702),
  [#4698](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4698))
- Upgraded yarn to version 1.6. Please note that you must use NodeJS
  version 9 or earlier with JupyterLab (i.e., not NodeJS version 10).
  We will upgrade yarn, with NodeJS version 10 support, when a [bug in
  yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/5935) is fixed.
  ([#4804](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4804))
- Various process utilities were moved to `jupyterlab_server`.
  ([#4696](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/4696))
